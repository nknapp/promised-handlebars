## How it works

Handlebars allows you to register helper functions and that can be called 
from the template. The template itself is compiled into the function that 
can be called to render a JSON.

This module wraps the compiled template function and helpers register with 
`registerHelper` in order to do the following:

* In case the helper returns an object that is `isPromiseAlike` (i.e. it is a non-`null` object with a 
  function method `then()`), the value is inserted into a temporary `promises-array`.

* The `.toString` method of the helper-return value is modified to return
  a concatenated string of
  * A placeholder-character that is not supposed to occur in the template (currently `\u0001`).
    The placeholder may also not occur in the output generated by helpers.
  * The index of the inserted value within the `promises-array` (as stringified digits)
  * A `>` character that is used to detect whether the helper output was be escaped.

* After the execution of the compiled template, a combined promise of all
  helper return values is created with `Q.all()` and returned when this 
  promise (i.e. all helper-return-values) are resolved, all placeholder 
  characters in the template output are replaced by the actual resolved values.
  The inserted `>`-character is now used to determine whether to escape the helper output.
  (If it is was converted to `&gt;`, it is escaped, otherwise not) 

The result is a promise for the finalized template output.

### Edge-cases

There are things to think about that are covered by this module:

* The promise-array only exists during one execution of the javascript event-loop.
  It will be reset to `null` once the template-execution is done and the `Q.all()` function
  is called. Otherwise there would be serious concurrency problems when the template
  is executed several times at the same time.

* Registered partials in are compiled by Handlebars with the same `compile` function
  as the template itself. However, they may not return a promise, because the caller-code
  is not expecting that.
  
  Since the `partial`-function is called from somewhere within the `template`-function, the
  promise-array already exists. Thus, the solution is, to call the `partial`-function directly
  if the promise-array already exists. This will then return a string instead of a promise.

* A block-helper may call `options.fn` and `option.inverse` from the `.then` function
  of a promise. The promise-array is already reset to `null` when those functions are executed,
  which means that they cannot insert any more promises. We solve this problem by wrapping
  those functions with the same mechanism as the `template`- and `partial`-functions:
  If the function is called in the same event-loop-cycle as the `template`-function, no
  wrapper is applied and the return value is passed on as-is.

  If the functions are called asynchronously from within a promise-`.then` function, the wrapper
  will be applied and a promise will be returned instead of the actual return value.
  The side-effect is that synchronous helper-libraries can still be used, while asynchronous
  block helpers are possible, but must handle the promise return-value correctly.
* Helper arguments (like in `\{{helper (promise-helper arg) hashArg=(promise-helper arg2)}}`)
  need to be resolved before running the actual helper.

* Builtin-helpers must be wrapped as well to allow something like `\{{#each (promise-helper arg)}}abc\{{/each}}`

### Caveats  / TODOs

**Customizable placeholder:** The algorithm currently uses the char `\u0001` as placeholder in the 
template. It may happen that the placeholder-sequence occurs in the template, a partial, the input data 
or that it is generated by helpers. In such a case, it will replaced by a promise result at some point.

This can be ommited by passing an other character in the `options` parameter, but this is not a complete solution.

**Known problems:** Although many edge-cases are handled by this module, there are some cases that 
cannot be handled properly.
The following example uses a synchronous block-helper `\{{#trim}}...\{{trim}}` to remove whitespace
from both ends of the enclosed block and a asynchronous helper `\{{promise-helper}}` that returns a
promise for a boolean value:

{{example 'examples/async-trim-failure.js'}}

The output of the example still contains the surrounding spaces, so the `\{{#trim}}` helper
appearently did not work:

{{exec 'node async-trim-failure.js' cwd='examples/' lang='inline'}}

The problem is, that the `\{{#if}}`-helper cannot be executed until the result of `\{{eventually-true}}`
is resolved. This means, that the `\{{#if}}`-helper must return a promise instead of the actual string.
Returning a promise means inserting a placeholder, but calling `.trim()` on the placeholder does not return
the whitespaces around the resolved result. 

If you are writing the `\{{#trim}}`-helper yourself, you can adjust it so that it uses promises:

{{example 'examples/async-trim-success.js' snippet=true}}

Then, the output will be correct: {{exec 'node async-trim-success.js' lang='inline' cwd='examples/'}}
 
If you cannot easily adapt the `\{{#trim}}`-helper, you have a problem.
**Suggestions welcome**.

### Other solutions for async-handlebars

* The problem of async-helpers was discussed in 
  [this issue in the Handlebars project on github](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/141).
  Some solutions are discussed there. The implementation of this module is similar to one of them.  

* There is a [handlebars-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-async)-package on npm, which
  works with callbacks instead of promises. It's version is currently 0.0.3 and the last release is 
  two years ago (as of July 2015), which is why I did not take a closer look. But it seems to use 
  uuids to mark insertion-points for promise-results.
